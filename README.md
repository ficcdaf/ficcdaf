# Daniel Fichtinger

I like programming, Linux, and cybersecurity.

You can learn more about me on my website, [ficd.ca](https://ficd.ca). I keep a
blog and post updates on my projects there.

I mainly hack on [sr.ht/~ficd](https://sr.ht/~ficd/). Most of my projects are
automatically [mirrored to GitHub](https://ficd.ca/blog/mirror-srht-to-github).
