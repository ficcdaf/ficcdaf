# Daniel Fichtinger

I like programming, Linux, and cybersecurity. You can learn more about me on my
website: [ficd.ca](https://ficd.ca). Check my [now page](https://ficd.ca/now) if
you want to know what I'm up to currently.

I host my projects on sourcehut: [sr.ht/~ficd](https://sr.ht/~ficd/) and
[git.sr.ht/~ficd](https://git.sr.ht/~ficd/). You can contact me via email:
[daniel@ficd.ca](mailto:daniel@ficd.ca)

I contribute to existing projects on GitHub if this is where they're hosted. I
continue to maintain GitHub mirrors for my projects that already have users
expecting them to be here; but I primarily develop on sourcehut.

My dotfiles are available [here](https://git.sr.ht/~ficd/dotfiles).
